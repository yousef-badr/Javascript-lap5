Abstract Class : (using functions)
 you can create an abstract class-like behavior using constructor functions and prototypes. 
 You can define methods in the prototype that act as abstract methods, 
 and then extend this "abstract class" to create concrete classes that implement those methods.
Interfaces : (using object literals)
JavaScript does not have a native concept of interfaces,
but you can achieve similar functionality using object literals.
You define an object with a set of methods that must be implemented by any object that wants to conform to the interface.
